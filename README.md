Hangman Game
Hangman Game is a fun and interactive game where users guess the name of a fruit by selecting letters. Users have limited lives, and each incorrect guess reduces their remaining attempts. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

Interactive UI: Users can select letters from an on-screen keyboard.
Dynamic Hangman Image: Displays the hangman image based on the number of lives left.
Randomized Words: The game selects a random fruit name for each round.
Reset Option: Users can reset the game to play again.
User-Friendly Feedback: Alerts notify users when they win or lose the game.
How to Play
Start the game by guessing letters using the on-screen keyboard.
Each correct guess reveals the corresponding letter(s) in the word.
Each incorrect guess decreases your lives, and the hangman image updates.
The game ends when:
You guess the word completely: "You Won" message.
You run out of lives: "Game Over" message.
Click the "Play Again!" button to restart the game with a new random word.
